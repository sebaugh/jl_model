This project aims to present an original model for simulating the freerider problem in public transportation system.

The main function is called bus_ride and it simulates one bus ride with a set number of stops which defines the basic cost of the ride, at the beginning there is a random number of passengers embarking on the bus, and a part of them rides as freeriders. At each subsequent stop the bus may but does not have to stop, if it happens a random number of passengers leave the bus and after that a random number embarks on it, again some of them are freeriders. Additionally, in case of a bus stop there may be a ticket control, if the bus is empty enough all of the present freeriders get caught and pay the fine, in a scenario in which there is too many passengers it is assumed that freeriders might be able to hide from the ticket controler in the crowd so every one of them is subjected to a lottery with a set probability. After all of the stops the revenue is calculated which is based on the number of the passengers, sold tickets, number of possible stops, flat cost of a ride, cost of a ticket control, paid fees from freeriders.
